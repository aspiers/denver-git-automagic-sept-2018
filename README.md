## Presentation for Git London User Group Meetup, 17th May 2018

This repo contains the source code for slides presented to the [Git
London User Group](http://londongit.org/)'s [Meetup event on 17th May
2018](https://www.meetup.com/londongit/events/248694943/).

It is based on
[a template by Adam Spiers](https://github.com/aspiers/presentation-template/)
which is in turn based on
[a template by Florian Haas](https://github.com/fghaas/presentation-template/)
which uses [`reveal.js`](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) (by
Hakim El-Hattab and contributors) as the underlying presentation
technology.
